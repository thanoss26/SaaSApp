```javascript
this.products = {
    starter: {
        name: 'Starter',
        monthly: {
            priceId: 'price_1OqX2Y3Z4A5B6C7D8E9F0G1H', // ⚠️ YOUR ACTUAL PRICE ID
            amount: 29,
            currency: 'eur',
            interval: 'month'
        },
        annual: {
            priceId: 'price_2PqX3Y4Z5A6B7C8D9E0F1G2H', // ⚠️ YOUR ACTUAL PRICE ID
            amount: 299,
            currency: 'eur',
            interval: 'year'
        }
    },
    // ... repeat for professional and enterprise
};
```

Ensure these are set in your `.env` file:
